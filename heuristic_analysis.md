# Heuristic Analysis
## Planning Search

## Results

## Visualization

Provide tables or other visual aids as needed for clarity in your discussion.

### Optimal Plan
Provide an optimal plan for Problems 1, 2, and 3.

### Uninformed Search Strategies
Compare and contrast non-heuristic search result metrics (optimality, time elapsed, number of node expansions) for Problems 1,2, and 3. Include breadth-first, depth-first, and at least one other uninformed non-heuristic search in your comparison; Your third choice of non-heuristic search may be skipped for Problem 3 if it takes longer than 10 minutes to run, but a note in this case should be included.


### Heuristic Search Strategies
Compare and contrast heuristic search result metrics using A* with the "ignore preconditions" and "level-sum" heuristics for Problems 1, 2, and 3.

### Conclusion
What was the best heuristic used in these problems? Was it better than non-heuristic search planning methods for all problems? Why or why not?
